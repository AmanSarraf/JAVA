//Program7: Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of account for its customers, one
//        called savings account and the other current account. The savings account provides
//        compound interest and withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility. The current
//        account provides cheque book facility but no interest. Current account holders should also
//        maintain a minimum balance and if the balance falls below this level, a service charge is
//        imposed.
//        Create a class Account that stores customer name, account number and type of account.
//        From this derive the classes Curr-acct and Sav-acct to make them more specific to their
//        requirements. Include the necessary methods in order to achieve the following tasks:
//        (a) Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance.
//        (b) Display the balance.
//        (c) Compute and deposit interest.
//        (d) Permit withdrawal and update the balance.
//        (e) Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty, if necessary and update the balance
